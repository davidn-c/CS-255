# DriverPass Design Reflection

    ##Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
    
    The DriverPass client was a new startup company that wished to venture into what they believed to be an untapped market of online driver training.  The DriverPass 
    project was to help realize their vision of improving the success rate of students taking their driver training and to add an additional layer of convenience to the
    process.  The company wished to design a system that would deliver content and provide acccess to driver training anywhere there exists an Internet connection.  The
    company wished to provide their fee based model over a wide variety of devices, including PCs, Macs, iOS, and Android devices.  Most importantly, the system would
    have the ability to allow its users to schedule tests, register for courses, and even schedule live behind the wheel training.  As an added benefit the system would
    also allow the company to keep track of their vehicle fleet and instructors.

    ##What did you do particularly well?
    The DriverPass project started out as a big idea with very little definition.  During our initial meetings with the client, they only shared surface level concepts
    that really did not define the project in enough detail to take it an run with it.  Under the circumstances, I felt that my ability to take these few concepts and build
    out a complete system was done particularly well.  In addition to the features that the company wished to add, I definied a full fledged system by adding my own
    experience to the design model.
    
    ##If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    I felt like the work I put into this project was fairly thorough.  Although, if I were able to revise any of the documents that I came up with to build this system I
    would probably want to tackle a more full featured UML diagram.  While I was only one person working on this project, it was unrealistic that I could build out all
    of the required UML code descriptions in the time alotted.  However, given more time I would like to improve upon the UML diagram and flesh it out as a complete product.
    
    ##How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    As I had previously mentioned, the user was very short on fleshing out their needs.  So to build on their ideas, I used what I gathered from our dialogue and 
    conducted further research on a similar product (i.e. the LMS models).  Using the examples it helped me to make what were building match more in line with the product
    that I was being asked to design and from it I was able to build the Business Requirement documents for the customer to confirm their acceptance of the initial design.
    
    ##How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
    I believe that there would be more than a single meeting for any software design project.  In reality, after the initial requirements gathering for a programming project, 
    my goal would be to hold follow-up customer meetings to gather requirements from the broader elements that were gathered during the initial requirements gathering session.  This 
    would help to address the issue I mentioned above where there was no fleshing out of ideas and much of what was to be done to fill in the gaps was done on my own, where 
    I would have preferred the customer have been involved in making the design decision.
